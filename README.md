# SATURN 2015 Workshop on Microservices Architecture

Over the past year or so Microservices Architecture has emerged as a widely discussed style for building distributed web/internet systems.  Proponents argue that this variant of service-oriented architecture (SOA) is well-suited to addressing the challenges of cloud computing, scalability, and complexity, among others.  It is often paired with DevOps (i.e., developer operations, where the development team is also responsible for deployment and management of the system).  SOA itself was criticized as a buzzword that rebranded existing patterns of distributed computing.  It is possible that microservices is a similar rebranding.

This workshop will explore various facets of microservices architecture.  Based on what we learn, we'll create a poster at the end of the day that summarizes our findings to share with the SATURN community during the conference Welcome Reception. [Some questions and topics we will consider during the workshop include the items listed on this page](questions.md).

The workshop took place on Monday, April 27, 2015 in [Baltimore, MD during the SATURN 2015 conference on software architecture](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2015/).

Workshop participants were asked to submit a position paper before the workshop as a way to prepare for the workshop discussions.  [References from across the web](references.md) and [some motiviating questions](questions.md) were compiled to help workshop participants prepare and think about their positions.

# About SATURN

The 11th SEI Architecture Technology User Network (SATURN) Conference — the longest-running software architecture conference in the world — brings together influential leaders and experts to discuss architecture-centric practices for developing, acquiring, and maintaining software-reliant systems. Architects from more than 20 countries meet annually at SATURN to share ideas, network, and learn about new and existing technologies.
